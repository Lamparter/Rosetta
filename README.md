# ðŸª¨ Rosetta

#### Decoding the layers of language.

Rosetta is a project that aims to unify the way text is represented in apps.
It creates a common format for all text document types to compile into, with support for a wide variety of features and an extensible framework that allows consumers to build their own custom controls for Rosetta.
Its base is in XML with a custom namespace schema that allows for developing basic documents. It can be expanded using more namespaces, to include support for things like fonts, custom text controls, text formatting, and more!
