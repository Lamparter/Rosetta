# ü™® Rosetta

#### Decoding the layers of language.

Rosetta is a project that aims to unify the way text is represented in apps.
It creates a common format for all text document types to compile into, with support for a wide variety of features and an extensible framework that allows consumers to build their own custom controls for Rosetta.
Its base is in XML with a custom namespace schema that allows for developing basic documents. It can be expanded using more namespaces, to include support for things like fonts, custom text controls, text formatting, and more!

## ‚úçÔ∏è Specification

Rosetta and its syntax is derived from XML and inspired by XAML markup. It follows all the rules of XML.
The root schema and its extensions are documented in this repository. This repository also provides tools for creating and distributing your own Rosetta extensions for building text elements that aren't already included in the BCL.
