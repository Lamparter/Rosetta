# Rosetta

The Rosetta .NET compiler provides document format languages with rich code analysis APIs.

---

Rosetta is a project that aims to unify the way text is represented in apps. It creates a common format for all text document types to compile into, with support for a wide variety of features and an extensible framework that allows consumers to build their own custom controls for Rosetta. Its base is in XML with a custom namespace schema that allows for developing basic documents. It can be expanded using more namespaces, to include support for things like fonts, custom text controls, text formatting, and more!
